# Bites and Booze
Bites and Booze is a web application that users can come to when they're in need of a little culinary inspiration! This app will provide users with recipes for both food and cocktails. The most recent searches and history for both food and drink are saved to local storage, so if a user leaves and comes back to the page, their most recent history will render upon loading the page.

## How to Use
* Upon loading, a user can search by a specific dish (i.e. "pizza" or "lasagna") or by a specific ingredient (i.e. "chicken", "spinach", or "cheese"), by typing the word into the search bar. 
* If a user wants to search by their mood, they can do so by clicking on the"Search by Mood" tab then choosing an option from the drop-down menu. 
* A user also can click on the "Feeling lucky? Try a Cocktail" button to generate three random cocktails!
