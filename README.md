# Bites and Booze
## Overview
Bites and Booze is a web application that users can come to when they're in need of a little culinary inspiration! This app will provide users with recipes for both food and cocktails. The most recent searches and history for both food and drink are saved to local storage, so if a user leaves and comes back to the page, their most recent history will render upon loading the page.

## How to Use
* Upon loading, a user can search by a specific dish (i.e. "pizza" or "lasagna") or by a specific ingredient (i.e. "chicken", "spinach", or "cheese"), by typing the word into the search bar. 
* If a user wants to search by their mood, they can do so by clicking on the"Search by Mood" tab then choosing an option from the drop-down menu. 
* A user also can click on the "Feeling lucky? Try a Cocktail" button to generate three random cocktails!

## Future Development
Bites and Booze plans on adding more features as the website progesses, such as:
* An increased recipe database via more APIs
* Advanced searches based on dietary preferences, cuisines, allergies, prep time, calories, and more
* Develop a mailing list for subscribers to communicate new recipes or other updates
* A feature that allows users to create an account and save recipes
* Allowing users to search for nearby grocery stores or restaurants
